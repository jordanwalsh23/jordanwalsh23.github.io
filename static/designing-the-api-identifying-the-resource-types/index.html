<p><em>(**Note: **If you get REST and how to structure a REST API, skip this post)...</em></p>
<p>When I was asked to design our API my first step was to watch <a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/restful_api_design" title="Teach a dog to REST">Teach a Dog to REST</a>. Then watch it again, and again. I made other members of the team watch it, and took as much as I could from it.</p>
<p>This video is probably the most elegant demonstration I've seen that articulates "proper" REST API design.</p>
<p>From here I took my instructions from the video and broke down the application into its different types of resources.</p>
<p>As the application I was dealing with was to do with SMS messaging, the resources became things like <strong>messages</strong>, <strong>message templates, recipients</strong>, and <strong>recipient groups</strong>.</p>
<p>I didn't start with the use cases, e.g. "how do I send a message" because identifying the resources and the resource types within the API is far more important at this stage than worrying about what you can do with the API.</p>
<p>The reason is that if you focus on the use cases (the verbs) you'll end up with a list of actions. This may sound OK, but ultimately this path will lead to a bunch of action based URLs e.g. /sendMessage, /createRecipient or (worse) /addRecipientToDistributionList.</p>
<p>Focus on the resources (the nouns) instead. What you actually want at this stage is simply the list of resource group URLs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/messages</strong></li>
<li><strong>/templates</strong></li>
<li><strong>/recipients</strong></li>
<li><strong>/recipientgroups</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>From here I simply thought of each of the main 4 HTTP verbs acting on my URLs; POST, GET, PUT and DELETE (Create, Read, Update and Delete respectively).</p>
<table width="100%">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Resource</th>
<th>GET</th>
<th>POST</th>
<th>PUT</th>
<th>DELETE</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>messages</td>
<td>Retrieve a listing of messages.</td>
<td>Create and send a new message</td>
<td>Not Implemented</td>
<td>Not Implemented (could refer to deleting all messages)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>message templates</td>
<td>Retrieve a listing of message templates</td>
<td>Create a new message template</td>
<td>Not Implemented</td>
<td>Not Implemented (could refer to deleting all templates)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>recipients</td>
<td>Retrieve a listing of recipients.</td>
<td>Create a new recipient</td>
<td>Not Implemented</td>
<td>Not Implemented (could refer to deleting all recipients)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>recipient groups</td>
<td>Retrieve a listing of recipient groups.</td>
<td>Create a new recipient group</td>
<td>Not Implemented</td>
<td>Not Implemented (could refer to deleting all groups)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> we still haven't gotten into any schemas or technical implementation details.  During this phase I am trying to define a simple API structure; that's it. After completing the table for the resource groupings, I then moved on to each individual resource.</p>
<table width="100%">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Resource</th>
<th>GET</th>
<th>POST</th>
<th>PUT</th>
<th>DELETE</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>messages/[ID]</td>
<td>Retrieve an individual message</td>
<td>Not Implemented</td>
<td>Update an individual message (possibly relevant for drafting)</td>
<td>Delete an individual message</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>messagetemplates/[ID]</td>
<td>Retrieve a message template</td>
<td>Not Implemented</td>
<td>Update an individual message template</td>
<td>Delete an individual message template</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>recipients/[ID]</td>
<td>Retrieve a recipient record</td>
<td>Not Implemented</td>
<td>Update an individual recipient record</td>
<td>Delete an individual recipient record</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>recipientgroups/[ID]</td>
<td>Retrieve a recipient group</td>
<td>Not Implemented</td>
<td>Update a recipient group's details, or add a recipient to the group.</td>
<td>Delete a recipient group</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Structuring my table like this forced me to think about what each action is going to perform as I only had 4 actions to work with (there are a few others but we'll get to them later).</p>
<p>For example, I made the call that when you performed a POST to /messages this would not only <strong>Create</strong> the Message, it would also <strong>Send</strong> it.</p>
<p>Some would argue that the resource should have been created in one step, and sent in another e.g. create it with a POST to /messages, then update it with a PUT to move it to a 'sent' state.</p>
<p>This was an option I considered, but I decided that more of my users would be sending messages in one single step than there were those that would require a draft/send process, so I went with the two in one approach.</p>
<p>When you are designing your API, I would encourage you to start here also.  It will take some time to map out what each resource is, and what the 4 verbs mean for each, but it will be worthwhile in the long run.</p>
